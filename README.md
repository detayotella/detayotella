# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adetayo Tella, a Software Engineer and Machine Learning Engineer who bridges the gap between robust software development and advanced AI solutions. I specialize in developing production-grade applications while leveraging machine learning techniques to solve complex real-world problems.

ðŸ’¡ With expertise in both traditional software engineering and ML systems, I architect end-to-end solutions that transform data into actionable intelligence. My focus lies in developing scalable ML pipelines and integrating them seamlessly into production software systems.

**Core Technologies**:
- Languages: Python | TypeScript | JavaScript | PHP | SQL
- ML/AI: PyTorch | Scikit-learn | Langchain 
- Software Development: Backend Development | API Design | System Architecture

I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible at the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence, constantly exploring innovative ways to deploy ML solutions that drive real business impact.

Would you like me to adjust any part of this to better reflect your experience or focus areas?
